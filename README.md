#### Personal Portfolio Website Template ####

Super simple, fast and easy to create a personal portfolio webpage and host it on GitHub-Pages.

### Usage ###

Fork this repo, and in your fork, switch to the gh-pages branch. Edit the website content to fit your personal needs. 
The completed page will be available at https://<username>.github.com/portfolio.

### Current Status ###

**4/15/2013**

* Basic functionality, including configuring the content with `config.js`, and populating the webpage with simple information (and formatting with one `css` file).
* *TODO:* provide multiple css stylesheets, include more info, including links, images, and, optionally, custom html.

* I just created this repo, and am in the process of creating this. Feel free to follow or offer contributions. I see this as being a really slick addition to the GitHub community.
