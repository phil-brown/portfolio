	I am currently working on many applications and libraries (primarily Android). I am not seeking employment ATM - just showcasing some of my work.
	<br>
	This website is not only my portfolio, but also my open source project. I
	created this site so that others could create a very simple portfolio page quickly,
	and host it freely on GitHub. Here's how:
	<ol>
		<li>Fork the repo - <a href="https://github.com/phil-brown/portfolio">https://github.com/phil-brown/portfolio</a>
		<li>If the gh-pages branch was not copied, create a new branch called 'gh-pages'. 
		<li>In the gh-pages branch, edit the file <tt>js/config.js</tt> to set the fields that can be displayed. 
		Any field (with some exceptions) can be set to a <i>string</i>, <i>html</i>, <tt>null</tt> or can simply not exist, and 
		it will be properly handled when the page is displayed. \The exceptions to this include the <i>images</i> 
		field and the <i>customHTML</i> field. The <i>customHTML</i> field should be the relative path to an HTML 
		file that contains the HTML for the optional custom section. The <i>image</i> field is an array of Objects 
		represented in JSON annotation that provide image paths, url links, and tooltip text - all of which are used 
		to show your portfolio images in a two-column table. The following string values are allowed: 
		<ul>
			<li>src
			<li>alt
			<li>title
			<li>link
		</ul>
	</ol>
